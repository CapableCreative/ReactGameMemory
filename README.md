<h1>Clicky (Memory) Game</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run npm i to install dependencies including:
    <ul>
       <li>React - React and standard create-app files</li>
       <li>React Dom - standard for React DOM actions</li>
       <li>React Card Flip - for 'smooth' card flip animation</li>
       <li>React Bootstrap - for bootstrap framework</li>
       <li>React Scripts - 'scripts and configuration used by Create-React'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>With React and dependencies installed, type "npm start" from the root my-app directory
</ol>

<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
To implement a simple React.js memory card app. The assignment was a click-based game where a clicked item state becomes "clicked". If clicked a second time, the game ends.

<b>NOTE:</b> I wanted to push myself and create a traditional memory card game, where cards flip, and are matched in pairs. I felt I could accomplish this, but ended up relying a bit more on existing code than intended. That said, I did note lines based on functionality. I do understand how it works, but I normally write everything from scratch. This homework was more reliant on referenced code than normal. &ndash; Stephen Fox

<h2>Goals</h2>
To create a simple memory-challenging application based on click events that leverages React's Virtual DOM and component-based DOM refresh for a fast js-based game.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
This implementation was a bit more challenging than I expected. I also found myself wishing I could use JQuery for traversing the DOM elements. That said, I learned (but haven't mastered) several new npm packages and React methods.

<h2>Result</h2>
This application is a click-based memory game, that adds some depth to recreate a more traditional experience.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
I will likely redo this homework after class finishes. I understand what's happening, but it's a bit more complicated than it needs to be and relies on more advanced React than I have mastered &ndash; specifically 'static' keyword ... I don't quite understand how it works.
